# Flexible Calculator
In this first release, this is just a simple calculator:
The idea is that this calculator in every new edition
gets a new mod to work with.
For example *music mode, where the keys would be labeled
some musical direction or group and click on it
music or video would be activated.
Then *game mode.
Mod *scientific calculator and such.
