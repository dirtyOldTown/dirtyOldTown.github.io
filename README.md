# Flexible Calculator

##General
In this first release, this is just a simple calculator:
The idea is that this calculator in every new edition
gets a new *mod* to work with.
For example **music mod**, where the keys would be labeled
some musical direction or group and click on it
music or video would be activated.
Then **game mod**, **scientific calculator mod** and such.
